# Setting the path to the chromedriver
You have to set the path to the chromedriver in config.py. Example:

# Running the code
The code can be run by executing: <getobs.py> after editing the 
link of the overview page of observations to the desired species, date etc. and a name is given.

The resulting .kml file gets the given name and is created in the same folder as the code is executed in.
