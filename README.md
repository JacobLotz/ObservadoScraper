# ObservadoScraper
Scraper in Python to scrape from observado.org

# Version
This script has been tested for python3.

The code can be run by executing: <getobs.py> after editing the 
link of the overview page of observations to the desired species, date etc. and a name is given.

The resulting .kml file gets the given name and is created in the same folder as the code is executed in.
